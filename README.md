## 🧠 Overview  
This paper presents a **low-cost, non-invasive tool** to measure nasal airflow and dominance — inspired by the principles of **Svara Yoga**.  
Using an **HX710B pressure sensor** and **Arduino**, the system detects airflow variations between nostrils to identify **Surya (right)** and **Chandra (left)** Svara states.

## ⚙️ Highlights  
- Simple, low-cost nasal dominance detection method  
- Real-time airflow measurement via pressure sensors  
- Validated through bilateral and single-nostril experiments  
- Potential applications in yoga, wellness, and clinical research
